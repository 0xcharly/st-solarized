st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

Addendum
--------

This fork of simple terminal sets a different font by default, namely Hack
(https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), and Solarized themes (default to "dark").

To select the theme at compile time, use either of these commands:

    make SOLARIZED_THEME=SOLARIZED_DARK
    make SOLARIZED_THEME=SOLARIZED_LIGHT

It also disables using bright colors for bold text. To re-enable this behavior,
use `-DDRAW_BOLD_TEXT_IN_BRIGHT_COLORS` (see the config.mk file).
